# Short-Random-Fiber-Network-Generation 
Comments on files are added for users to understand the script & variables used.
•	VolumeFraction.m: Finding fiber volume fraction in composite & generating text file to be used in colormaps.m.
•	Colormaps.m: Generates Color Map.
•	StraightThickThinFibers: Generates straight fibers which could be thin or thick depending upon user’s input.
•	CurvedThickThinFibers: Generates curved fibers which could be thin or thick depending upon user’s input.
•	StraightFiberInterfaces: Generates straight fibers and interfaces.
•	CurvedFiberInterfaces: Generates curved fibers and interfaces.
•	circles.m: Function file for generating curved fibers and/or interfaces. This file is necessary to be in the current directory to generate curved fibers with or without interfaces.
